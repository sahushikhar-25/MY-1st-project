Dear Prof. Chatterjee
I would like to inform you that we are going to organize a technical symposium
on the fourth Sunday of this month. Many eminent personalities from industry and
academia are going to participate in this event. Looking at the success of the
previous year's event, we are expecting huge participation this year. In this event, the students
can gather knowledge about the latest technologies. Many eminent vendors are setting 
up their stalls to give demos about their products. In the symposium, there will be
some topics for interaction. Various competitions are being held as a part of the 
symposium. It is a wonderful opportunity to exchange ideas and win exciting prizes.
Regards

Dear Mr. Sharma
We are residents of Avas Vikas Colony. We are writing to inform you about 
a serious issue in our residential area. Every evening, some people ride 
bikes rashly near our society. This riding is causing a lot of trouble in society.
Many children play in this area, and elderly residents often walk or visit grocery
shops across the road. Their rash riding can lead to accidents and has become a
nuisance. I kindly request you to take immediate action to stop this activity.
We hope you will take action soon to ensure the safety of our community.
Sincerely
William

Dear Mr. Roy
We regret to inform you about a delay in the submission of the 'Payment
Processing System' project, originally scheduled for completion on Friday,
May 10. Unfortunately, an unexpected power outage disrupted our workflow,
leading to a 3-day delay. As a result, the overall delay has been extended by 
7 days. We have put a recovery plan in place to address the lost work.
Our team has prioritized tasks to ensure the remaining work to be completed
efficiently. Additionally, measures have been taken to prevent such incidents
from recurring.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may cause and appreciate your 
understanding.
Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely
Lucifer
